This Includes :
                      1. THE use of HC05 bluetooth controller interface which can be used for motor control 
                      2. ASCII command given as input from smartphones using HC05 interface which is then used for controlling the output as HIGH or LOW in Arduino.
                      3. Line follower uses two IR sensors for sensing the Black Line which is followed by the car as shown in the above video which is again programmed through 
                          Arduino.
